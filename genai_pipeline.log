Summarize the following text in a clear and concise manner:

Generative Artificial Intelligence refers to AI systems that can create new content such as text, images, audio, and code based on user input. These systems use large language models trained on vast amounts of data to understand patterns and generate human-like responses. Generative AI is widely used in applications like chatbots, automated content creation, text summarization, and recommendation systems. While these technologies improve productivity and creativity, they also raise concerns related to data privacy, misinformation, and ethical usage. Therefore, careful design, evaluation, and responsible deployment of generative AI systems are essential.
