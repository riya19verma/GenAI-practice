    "original_text": "Generative Artificial Intelligence is a branch of AI that focuses on creating new content such as text, images, audio, and code. It uses large language models trained on massive datasets to understand context and generate meaningful outputs. Generative AI is widely applied in chatbots, document summarization, recommendation systems, and automated content creation. Despite its benefits, it introduces challenges related to data privacy, ethical concerns, and misinformation. Therefore, responsible development and evaluation of generative AI systems are essential to ensure safe and effective usage.",
